Attempting to migrate _nixbld users.

Step 1: move existing _nixbld users out of the destination UID range.
Password:
   Temporarily moved _nixbld5 from uid 305 -> 31000
   Temporarily moved _nixbld6 from uid 306 -> 31001
   Temporarily moved _nixbld7 from uid 307 -> 31002
   Temporarily moved _nixbld8 from uid 308 -> 31003
   Temporarily moved _nixbld9 from uid 309 -> 31004
   Temporarily moved _nixbld10 from uid 310 -> 31005
   Temporarily moved _nixbld11 from uid 311 -> 31006
   Temporarily moved _nixbld12 from uid 312 -> 31007
   Temporarily moved _nixbld13 from uid 313 -> 31008
   Temporarily moved _nixbld14 from uid 314 -> 31009
   Temporarily moved _nixbld15 from uid 315 -> 31010
   Temporarily moved _nixbld16 from uid 316 -> 31011
   Temporarily moved _nixbld17 from uid 317 -> 31012
   Temporarily moved _nixbld18 from uid 318 -> 31013
   Temporarily moved _nixbld19 from uid 319 -> 31014
   Temporarily moved _nixbld20 from uid 320 -> 31015
   Temporarily moved _nixbld21 from uid 321 -> 31016
   Temporarily moved _nixbld22 from uid 322 -> 31017
   Temporarily moved _nixbld23 from uid 323 -> 31018
   Temporarily moved _nixbld24 from uid 324 -> 31019
   Temporarily moved _nixbld25 from uid 325 -> 31020
   Temporarily moved _nixbld26 from uid 326 -> 31021
   Temporarily moved _nixbld27 from uid 327 -> 31022
   Temporarily moved _nixbld28 from uid 328 -> 31023
   Temporarily moved _nixbld29 from uid 329 -> 31024
   Temporarily moved _nixbld30 from uid 330 -> 31025
   Temporarily moved _nixbld31 from uid 331 -> 31026
   Temporarily moved _nixbld32 from uid 332 -> 31027

Step 2: re-create missing early _nixbld# users.
      _nixbld1 was missing; created with uid: 351
      _nixbld2 was missing; created with uid: 352
      _nixbld3 was missing; created with uid: 353
      _nixbld4 was missing; created with uid: 354

Step 3: relocate remaining _nixbld# UIDs to 354+
      _nixbld5 migrated to uid: 355
      _nixbld6 migrated to uid: 356
      _nixbld7 migrated to uid: 357
      _nixbld8 migrated to uid: 358
      _nixbld9 migrated to uid: 359
      _nixbld10 migrated to uid: 360
      _nixbld11 migrated to uid: 361
      _nixbld12 migrated to uid: 362
      _nixbld13 migrated to uid: 363
      _nixbld14 migrated to uid: 364
      _nixbld15 migrated to uid: 365
      _nixbld16 migrated to uid: 366
      _nixbld17 migrated to uid: 367
      _nixbld18 migrated to uid: 368
      _nixbld19 migrated to uid: 369
      _nixbld20 migrated to uid: 370
      _nixbld21 migrated to uid: 371
      _nixbld22 migrated to uid: 372
      _nixbld23 migrated to uid: 373
      _nixbld24 migrated to uid: 374
      _nixbld25 migrated to uid: 375
      _nixbld26 migrated to uid: 376
      _nixbld27 migrated to uid: 377
      _nixbld28 migrated to uid: 378
      _nixbld29 migrated to uid: 379
      _nixbld30 migrated to uid: 380
      _nixbld31 migrated to uid: 381
      _nixbld32 migrated to uid: 382
Migrated 32 users. If you want to double-check, try:
dscl . list /Users UniqueID | grep _nixbld | sort -n -k2
